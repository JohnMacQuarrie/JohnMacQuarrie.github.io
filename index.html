Welcome.  This is the homepage of John MacQuarrie.  I'm to your real left looking stage right, theatrically, at a deer.  
</p>

<p>

<p>
Fear not hippy!  I'm not a deer-hunter and haven't been since the "Bambi incident", there's no deathlust in my eyes!
In fact, day upon standard day of my life I spend as a third year maths PhD-hope-to-be 
at <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/">Manchester University</a>, where I do what I call (to be perverse rather than helpful) 
"topological algebra" under the expert supervision of <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/%7Epas/">Peter Symonds</a>, who to my knowledge
also doesn't hunt deer.
</p>

<p>
I'm Scottish, and when it's convenient I'm half Irish.  More importantly I'm from Glasgow and from experience can state that I'll get more upset 
about jibes  regarding the life-expectancy in Glasgow than I will about those suggesting that Scotland is a scab on the side of Rule-Brittania
that would fizzle out and die without England to hold its hand.  Not wanting to retrospectively break from the theme of my life, I did maths for 
my undergrad at <a href="http://www-maths.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">St Andrews University</a> which is beautiful and has an exceptional pure maths 
department full of exceptionally nice folk.
</p>

<p>
Other parts of this site can be reached using the (probably abusive) tabs to your real left.  You are more than welcome to click them, but 
if you'd rather guess what the URLs are going to be I'd honestly not want to stop you even if I could which I can't luckily for you.
