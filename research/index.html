<p>I'm a representation theorist.  The algebras and modules I like to study are sometimes "big", but they built (via inverse limits) from 
    "small" objects and they come with a natural topology that remembers they are made from small things.  This remarkably well behaved 
    topology allows powerful results that hold for small objects to pass to very large ones.  In order to extend a result from the small objects 
    to the limit, one must ensure that when you apply the result to the small objects, you respect the relationships between them.  In other 
    words, one must make precise the "naturality" of results.  This is often worth doing for its own sake, as it results in a clearer 
    understanding of the results for the small objects.

<p> My research as two main focuses, which overlap but have very different goals and use very different techniques.  My favourite thing in the 
    world is when techniques from one help with the other.
